### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/SamuelMaiko/dating-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd dating-app
    ```

4. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. [Set up the environment variables](#environment-configuration)

6. Set up the database:
    - **For development purposes**, you can use SQLite. Ensure your `settings.py` file has the following configuration commented/uncommented accordingly:
        ```python
        # settings.py

        #Use this for development with SQLite

         DATABASES = {
             'default': {
                 'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                 'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
             }
         }

        #Use this for production with PostgreSQL

        # DATABASES = {
        #    'default': {
        #        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        #        'NAME': config('DATABASE_NAME'),
        #        'USER': config('DATABASE_USER'),
        #        'PASSWORD': config('DATABASE_PASSWORD'),
        #        'HOST': config('DATABASE_HOST'),
        #        'PORT': config('DATABASE_PORT', default='5432'),
        #    }
        # }
        ```
        
        - **For production purposes**, configure the environment variables in your `.env` file:
        ```plaintext
        DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name
        DATABASE_USER=your_database_user
        DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password
        DATABASE_HOST=your_database_host
        DATABASE_PORT=your_database_port
        ```

7. Create a superuser for admin access:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

8. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Environment Configuration

Before running the project, you need to set up your environment variables. Follow these steps:

1. Copy the example environment variables file to create your own `.env` file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor:
    In VS code 

    **OR** 

    ```bash
    nano .env  # or use any other text editor
    ```

3. Fill in your own configuration details. Hereâ€™s an explanation of each variable:

    ```plaintext
    # .env

    DEBUG=True  # Set to False in production

    # Database configuration
    DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name
    DATABASE_USER=your_database_user
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    DATABASE_HOST=your_database_host
    DATABASE_PORT=your_database_port

    # Email settings
    EMAIL_BACKEND=your_email_backend
    EMAIL_HOST=your_email_host
    EMAIL_PORT=your_email_port
    EMAIL_USE_TLS=True  # or False, depending on your configuration
    EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email_user
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password

    # Additional settings
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1  # Add your allowed hosts here
    ```

## Known Issues

### 1. Serving Images in Production
- **Description:** The application is not currently configured to serve images in a production environment.
- **Status:** Configuration pending
- **Workaround:** None currently available. Please use a local development setup for image-related features until this is added.

### 2. Real-time Messaging Not Implemented
- **Description:** Real-time messaging is not implemented due to existing bugs that are currently under investigation.

- **Workaround:** Users can use alternative communication methods or refresh the chat manually. Real-time messaging will be added once the issues are resolved.

### 3. Database Configuration
- **Description:** The application is still using SQLite for the database and has not been connected to a hosted database.
- **Status:** Migration to a hosted database is planned
- **Workaround:** For development purposes, SQLite is sufficient. For production, please configure a PostgreSQL database as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.
